  abstract = {In cold agricultural regions, seasonal snowmelt over frozen soils provides the primary source of runoff and transports large nutrient loads downstream. The postglacial landscape of the Canadian Prairies and Northern Plains of the United States creates challenges for hydrological and water quality modeling. Here, the application of conventional hydrological models is problematic because of cold regions hydrological and chemical processes, the lack of fluvially eroded drainage systems, large noncontributing areas to streamflow and level topography. A new hydrodynamic model was developed to diagnose overland flow from snowmelt in this situation. The model was used to calculate the effect of variable contributing areas on (1) hydrological connectivity and the development of (2) tipping points in streamflow generation and (3) predominant chemical transport pathways. The agricultural Steppler Basin in Manitoba, Canada, was used to evaluate the model and diagnose snowmelt runoff. Relationships were established between contributing area and (1) snowmelt runoff intensity, (2) seasonal snowmelt volumes and duration, and (3) inundated, active and connected areas. Variations in the contributing area depended on terrain and snowmelt characteristics including wind redistribution of snow. Predictors of hydrological response and the size of the contributing area were developed which can be used in larger scale hydrological models of similar regions},

Risk assessment at the local scale can be seen as an important tool to assist the decision makers to identify and prioritize development, preparedness, and emergency. This paper introduces an integrated framework to assess urban pluvial flood risk, taking into consideration the available coping capacity arrangements as the coping capacity is considered to be the main factor to control the risk impact. The presented framework incorporates the pluvial flood inundation model; the building and social vulnerabilities indices; and coping capacity indicators to identify the risk level in the urban areas and to test the different scenarios for the disaster risk reduction measures. The proposed risk assessment framework has been applied to the city of Alexandria, located in northern Egypt, as there is an increase in pluvial floods in the city causing economic and human losses. A risk map for Almontaza district has been prepared to reveal the risk level for each block, this map can be used for the planning purposes. The introduced framework can increase the efficiency of the preparedness and emergency plans; it can also help the planners to direct the available development resources to the priority areas.},

The till consists of an upper weathered zone (9 to 18 m thick) and a lower nonweathered zone (10 to 30 m thick). The presence of tritiated ground water at depths of up to 5 m below the water table in the weathered zones shows that the upper part of the weathered zone is hydrogeologically active. Interpretation of hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity data, indicates that vertical seepage velocities in the nonweathered till zones range from 2 to 6 m per 1000 years. Calculated lateral ground-water velocities in the till zones are only about 9 m per 1000 years, and it is concluded that most of the ground water recharging the weathered till zone is returned to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. Oxygen-18 and deuterium analyses of ground-water samples for the weathered till zones support this conclusion.},

  abstract = {Effective management strategies are needed to control phosphorus loading of prairie watersheds that contribute to the eutrophication issues of Lake Winnipeg. Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) wetlands provide many ecosystems services including reducing nutrient mobility. Preferential conservation of PPR wetlands with calcium carbonate (CaCO3)-enriched soils may be a more effective strategy for controlling phosphorus loading, as these soils have greater potential to retain phosphorus from agricultural runoff. The spatial distribution of CaCO3-enriched wetland soils is controlled by hydrologic processes that may be modellable using high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). Two modelling approaches were tested to map spatial distributions of wetlands and wetland soils expected to be enriched with CaCO3. The models were trained and tested with wetland salinity and soil profile information collected at three Saskatchewan PPR sites, near Swift Current, St. Denis, and Smith Creek. The first model was developed to approximate landscape-scale hydrologic processes from high-resolution DEMs to predict the distributions of fresh and solute-rich wetlands; the solute-rich wetlands represent wetlands expected to have CaCO3-enriched soils. Spill channel connections between wetlands were modelled to characterize wetlands in terms of the runoff contributions they receive, their potential for contributing runoff downslope, and their relative position within the landscape; solute-richness predictions were based on these characteristics. This model was successful and achieved acceptable predictive accuracies based on external validation tests. Digital soil mapping (DSM) methodologies were tested for predicting the spatial distribution of wetland soil classes within PPR landscapes. Target soil classes were defined by hydropedological units that reflect differences in soil CaCO3 enrichment. Multiple machine-learning techniques were tested, which incorporated many topographic attributes derived from the DEMs as predictor variables, including knowledge-based topographic attributes developed specifically to characterize the PPR's morphology. Certain DSM models achieved acceptable predictive accuracy based on external validation tests and mapped soils in expected distributions, but none predicted the occurrence of wetlands with CaCO3-enriched soils distributed throughout their basins. Both modelling approaches could potentially be used to 1) identify wetlands with CaCO3-enriched soils to target for conservation efforts to maximize phosphorus retention and 2) create upscaled estimates of phosphorus retention across the PPR.},

  abstract = {Stream burning is a common flow enforcement technique used to correct surface drainage patterns derived from digital elevation models (DEM). The technique involves adjusting the elevations of grid cells that are coincident with the features of a vector hydrography layer. This paper focuses on the problematic issues with common stream burning practices, particularly the topological errors resulting from the mismatched scales of the hydrography and DEM data sets. A novel alternative stream burning method is described and tested using five DEMs of varying resolutions (1 to 30 arc-seconds) for an extensive area of southwestern Ontario, Canada. This TopologicalBreachBurn method uses total upstream channel length (TUCL) to prune the vector hydrography layer to a level of detail that matches the raster DEM grid resolution. Network pruning reduces the occurrence of erroneous stream piracy caused by the rasterization of multiple stream links to the same DEM grid cell. The algorithm also restricts flow within individual stream reaches, further reducing erroneous stream piracy. In situations where two vector stream features occupy the same grid cell, the new tool ensures that the larger stream, designated by higher TUCL, is given priority. TUCL-based priority minimizes the impact of the topological errors that occur during the stream rasterization process on modeled regional drainage patterns. The test data demonstrated that TopologicalBreachBurn produces highly accurate and scale-insensitive drainage patterns and watershed boundaries. The drainage divides of four large watersheds within the study region that were delineated from the TopologicalBreachBurn-processed DEMs were found to be highly accurate when compared with the official watershed boundaries, even at the coarsest grid resolutions, with Kappa index of agreement values ranging from 0.952 to 0.921. The corresponding Kappa coefficient values for a traditional stream burning method (FillBurn) ranged from 0.953 to 0.490, demonstrating a significant decrease in mapping accuracy at coarser DEM grid resolutions.

  abstract = {A hydrological model was used to examine the water balance of the Delta Marsh Watershed (DMW) currently and as impacted by land use changes. Understanding DMW hydrology can help to improve conditions in the Delta Marsh. MIKE SHE model results showed that the water balance is typical of prairie conditions with limited wintertime activity, significant spring melt runoff, and high summertime evapotranspiration and infiltration. Results showed that the DMW contributes approximately 40 million m3 of water to the Delta Marsh in an average year, or 710 m3/ha/yr. Portage Creek is the single greatest inflow from the watershed (31\% of total) and the West Marsh area also receives large runoff volumes (combined 37\% of total). Analysis of land use changes showed that urban expansion in the DMW would increase annual marsh inflows by over 50\% under one urbanization scenario due to associated decreases in infiltration and transpiration. An agricultural shift towards row crop predominance would have minimal impact on the DMW water balance. Conversion of cropland to natural vegetation would decrease annual runoff by 12\% to the marsh due to increased surface ponding, infiltration, and transpiration.},

  abstract = {The Canadian Shield landscape includes bedrock uplands and valleys infilled with soil. A site near Yellowknife in subarctic Canada was studied to elucidate the hydrological behaviour of soil-filled valleys. A suite of hydrological processes was found to be important in the studied valley, including snowmelt and rainfall, ground frost development, evaporation, infiltration, lateral inflow from adjacent uplands, and surface and subsurface flows. Valley storage requirements during snowmelt are met by local meltwater infiltration, but lateral inflows in the summer are needed to satisfy the storage before runoff can be generated from the valley. The valleys perform three functions of collecting vertical and lateral water inputs, retaining and losing the water held in storage, and transferring water down the valley and generating local outflow. Unlike channel flows in humid areas, runoff from the upper valley has to meet the storage demands of the lower valley segments, often causing seepage loss along flow paths to render the flows intermittent. A fill-and-spill runoff system is proposed in which the valley physiography results in a series of segments with varying storage conditions. As water is supplied to the valley, each segment has to be filled until its storage threshold for runoff is exceeded. Then, subsurface or surface flows will be generated, but these flows may be arrested to furnish water to satisfy the storage requirements of the segments downstream. Such a flow system applies also to other valleys in the Shield environment. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Prairie hydrology is unique in the world representing as post-glacial  depressions which form millions of wetlands which do not connect to a larger-scale drainage system. These wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services (ES) contributing to the resilience of Prairie landscapes in both flooding and drought events as they absorb surges of rain, snow, and floodwater while provide a hedge against drought. However, the growing demand for food has led to significant conversion of wetlands to croplands or pastureland in the past few decades over the Prairies. This has altered hydrological regimes and changed values of ES. Studies have been conducted to assess temporal changes in ES of Prairie wetlands due to farmers' drainage activities. However, spatial analysis is still limited due to the data constraint and a lack of suitable hydrological models that capture spatial dynamics of the complicated prairie hydrology. In this paper, the Wetland DEM Ponding Model (WDPM) is used to simulate the spatial distribution of water over a Prairie basin in Saskatchewan of Canada under combined climatic and drainage scenarios. The model applies simulated water to the 5m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the land using three modules (ADD, SUBSTRACT and DRAIN), and is used to investigate the distributions of ponds on a seasonal basis, given a range of different climatic and antecedent soil moisture conditions (from very dry to wet years). Three drainage scenarios (without drainage, 50\% drainage, and fully drained) are generated according to rules of topography, proximity to wetlands, and connectivity to the existing drainage networks. We then estimate changes in the area of wetlands (m2), using a simplified model that captures the relation between water depth (h) and wetland area (A), due to changes of water distribution over the landscape. ES of wetlands are calculated in monetary terms based on a set of cost-benefit and benefit transfer approaches. The adjusted values are overlaid with the simulated wetland distribution map at a 5m grid resolution according to the current land use patterns provided by Ducks Unlimited Canada. The results of this study can help policy makers find solutions to balance the trade-offs between drainage activities and wetland protection, as well adaptive strategies to changing climate.},
