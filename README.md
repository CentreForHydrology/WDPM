# WDPM
The Wetland DEM Ponding Model (WDPM) was developed at the Centre for Hydrology at the University of Saskatchewan to model the spatial distribution of water in depressions in the Canadian Prairies.  

The program is described in 

Shook, K., J. W. Pomeroy, C. Spence, and L. Boychuk (2013), Storage dynamics simulations in prairie wetland hydrology models: evaluation and parameterization, Hydrol. Process., 27(13), 1875â€“1889, doi:10.1002/hyp.9867. 

Please cite all uses of the program.

The executable files are too large to be distributed through GitHub. They are available at http://www.usask.ca/hydrology/WDPM.php along with additional documentation.
